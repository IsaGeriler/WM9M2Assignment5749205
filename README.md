# WM9M2Assignment5749205
## What is planned to be included
-	One or more textured and lit 3D game levels
-	Meshes rendered into the game level
    * Data driven level loading, i.e. load the game meshes and data from a custom file format
    *	Opaque meshes
    *	Meshes such as grass which require alpha testing
    *	Mesh which includes vertex shader animation 
    *	Instancing of meshes such as trees
-	First or third person camera movement controlled with keyboard and mouse
-	Animated game characters which interact with the player in some way via the use of an animation controller (attack / dialogue etc; this depends on the type of game)
-	Simple AABB or OOBB collision detection and response
-	Normal mapping or variant ( e.g. displacement or parallax occlusion mapping)
-	Simulating one or more effects covered in the lectures (e.g. water, particle system, skybox)
