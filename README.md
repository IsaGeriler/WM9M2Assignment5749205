    *	Opaque meshes
    *	Meshes such as grass which require alpha testing
    *	Mesh which includes vertex shader animation 
    *	Instancing of meshes such as trees
-	First or third person camera movement controlled with keyboard and mouse
-	Animated game characters which interact with the player in some way via the use of an animation controller (attack / dialogue etc; this depends on the type of game)
